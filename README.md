## 1. Introduction to ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed to understand and generate human-like text. It can answer questions, write content, provide explanations, brainstorm ideas, and more.

- **Who can use it?**  
  Anyone! You don’t need to be a programmer.

- **What can it do?**  
  Answer questions, help with writing, coding, researching, tutoring, translating, summarizing, and more.

## 2. How ChatGPT Works

ChatGPT is powered by a type of neural network model called a Transformer. It has been trained on a large dataset of text from the internet to predict the next word in a sequence, allowing it to generate coherent responses.

- **Transformer Architecture**  
- **Tokenization**  
- **Training on Large Corpora**

It doesn’t "know" things the way humans do; it generates plausible text based on patterns.

## 3. Getting Started

### Step 1: Access ChatGPT

Choose a platform where ChatGPT is available. This could be a website, app, or a custom interface in your project.

### Step 2: Start Typing

Just type in a question or statement like:

- "Help me write a poem about space."

### Step 3: Read the Response

ChatGPT will respond in a few seconds. You can continue the conversation naturally.

## 4. Understanding Prompts

A prompt is what you type into ChatGPT. It’s the input that the model responds to.

### Examples:
- "What is the capital of Japan?"
- "Summarize this article in three sentences."
- "Write a story about a dragon who learns to dance."

Prompts can be short or long, simple or complex.

- Example: "Write a professional email requesting a meeting to discuss project timelines."

### Use Instructions
- "List 5 benefits of meditation."
- "Convert this sentence into passive voice."

### Experiment
